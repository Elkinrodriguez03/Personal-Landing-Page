                <h3>HTML5 & CSS</h3>
                <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and it is the language that is used to define the structure of a web page. HTML is used along with CSS and Javascript to design web pages. HTML is the basic building block of a website. It has different attributes and elements with different properties. Each element has an opening and a closing tag.

                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it is used to style web documents. It is used to provide the background color and is also used for styling. It can also be used to style the font and change its size. It can also be used along with HTML and Javascript to design web pages.

                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                <p>JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS.

                Many browsers use JavaScript as a scripting language for doing dynamic things on the web. Any time you see a click-to-show dropdown menu, extra content added to a page, and dynamically changing element colors on a page, to name a few features, you're seeing the effects of JavaScript.</p>

            <div class="service">
                <h3>ReactJS</h3>
                <p>React.js, more commonly known as React, is a free, open-source JavaScript library. It works best to build user interfaces by combining sections of code (components) into full websites. Originally built by Facebook, Meta and the open-source community now maintain it. One of the good things about React is that you can use it as much or as little as you want! For example, you can build your entire site in React or just use one single React component on one page.</p>

                I am passionate about learning and getting new challenges to improve my skills and develop new ones. As a self-teaching person, I spend my free time looking for resources, tools and useful information in areas of my interest. I started learning English this way, building an English environment around me, reading books, watching videos about grammar statements, listening to music and meeting interested people on language exchange. Learning this new language has helped me to understand and learn faster about software development because the most popular programming languages are based on English, which is an advantage to grow in this big industry. In the same way that I learned my second language, I have been working on improving my knowledge and technical skills creating some personal projects and also taking some virtual courses and certifications on Front-end and Back-end technologies. I have been working in the Development industry as a Front-end consultant for more than a year, providing support on debugging code, implementation of new features and design of the UI. Currently I am looking for bigger challenges to continue my learning-process and give my contribution to this amazing career.
